      " DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp will offer buyouts or early retirements to all 74,000 U.S. hourly workers represented by the United Auto Workers in a sweeping deal with the union intended to clear the way for GM to hire lower-cost replacements. The cost-saving agreement follows a program launched in January for about 5,200 workers at GM's service parts and operations facilities across the United States and five other facilities, and comes with better terms than GM offered to UAW workers in 2006. GM representatives said it would take weeks to introduce the complicated buyout offers to its workers, who will have 45 days to consider them and then seven days to reconsider. It expects to complete the voluntary program by July 1. The benefits of the workforce transformation plan will start to hit GM \"later this year and into '09,\" Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson told reporters on Tuesday. The costs of the buyout program will begin to accrue to GM in the first half of 2008 as the workers opt for one of the programs, Henderson said. GM's agreement with the UAW follows similar deals the union reached with Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC following the 2007 contracts that allow U.S. car makers to hire many workers at lower wages and benefits, while guaranteeing some jobs. GM executives have said the automaker will take advantage of a ground-breaking contract provision that will allow the automaker to hire workers at second-tier wages, but they have declined to say how many of the current workers who take the offers will be replaced. GM said it would offer better terms and more choices for its already-retirement-eligible UAW workers, including increasing payouts to $45,000 for production workers and $62,500 for skilled trades workers. The automaker had offered $35,000 cash across the board in 2006 for its retirement-eligible workers, but Ford and Chrysler recently increased their retirement incentives for hourly workers and the U.S. economy has weakened since 2006. Workers may choose a lump-sum payment, an annuity, or roll part or all of it into an individual retirement account or a 401K to postpone the tax hit and potentially make the offer worth much more than those on offer for UAW workers at Ford. GM factory workers who retire after 30 years currently have pensions of about $3,100 per month, plus health benefits. The company also has lowered the eligibility for an enhanced retirement program for workers with 26 years experience who will be allowed to take what amounts to a reduced pension for four years before entering full retirement. GM workers who are over 50 with at least 10 years experience may retire with reduced pensions, plus benefits. UAW workers with more than 10 years experience also could opt for a $140,000 lump-sum buyout to leave with only their accrued pensions, or $70,000 if they have less than 10 years. GM does not plan to release a target for the number of workers it expects to participate. It plans to release a final figure when the program is completed, possibly in July, representatives said. The deals for GM's workers differ from Ford's and Chrysler's in part because of the differing ages of the work forces and company objectives. More than 34,000 workers left GM after accepting buyout packages that ranged from $35,000 to as much as $140,000 in 2006. The buyout offers from the U.S.-based automakers come amid concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy and the possibility that U.S. industry light vehicle sales could slump more in 2008, after a drop in 2007. Top executives of GM, Ford and Chrysler all have said in recent weeks that they would take further restructuring actions if necessary because of economic conditions. All three automakers reached agreements with the UAW that would allow them to hire new workers for some jobs starting at $14 per hour, or about half the current average hourly wage. U.S. automakers have been cutting capacity to match their declines in market share and their new UAW contracts allow them to shift their union retiree health-care obligations to union-controlled trusts.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Corporate whistleblowers could score multi-million-dollar payouts for reporting financial wrongdoing under a new program approved by securities regulators on Wednesday. A divided Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 to finalize the measure that has grown into one of the most contentious requirements of last year's Dodd-Frank Wall Street overhaul law. Tipsters would be paid between 10 and 30 percent of sanctions over $1 million for original and useful information. Companies from Google Inc to JPMorgan Chase & Co have expressed fears the whistleblower rule will undermine internal compliance programs at public companies by encouraging employees to go directly to the SEC. The rule does not require whistleblowers to first, or simultaneously, report problems internally, as companies had sought. In a concession to companies, the final SEC version would make a whistleblower still eligible for a reward if he or she reports wrongdoing to the company, and the company, in turn, reports it to the SEC. A whistleblower can also improve the chances of receiving a higher percentage award by internal reporting, but the rule only protects the whistleblower from retaliation if the employee also reports wrongdoing to the SEC. Business interests such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce remain deeply unhappy about the rule and could appeal in court. The SEC had put \"trial lawyer profits ahead of effective compliance,\" the chamber said in a statement. Rewarding whistleblowers has a long history in the United States. Last year the U.S. Department of Justice gave former GlaxoSmithKline Plc employee Cheryl Eckard a $96 million reward under the U.S. False Claims Act, a Civil War-era law designed to uncover efforts to defraud government programs. BREAK THE SILENCE The SEC rule greatly expands the agency's authority to reward whistleblowers. Prior to Dodd-Frank the SEC could only reward whistleblowers for tips on insider-trading cases. \"Today's rules are intended to the break the silence of those who see a wrong,\" said SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. She said the final measure struck the correct balance between encouraging whistleblowers to report problems internally when appropriate, while providing the option of heading directly to the SEC. SEC enforcement chief Robert Khuzami told the SEC's public meeting on Wednesday that the rule was already encouraging people to come forward. People who provided tips after Dodd-Frank was signed into law last July could be eligible for a reward. The SEC's two Republican commissioners voted against the rule and raised numerous concerns, from its impact on internal compliance to fears it may inundate the SEC with complaints that do not prove to be fruitful. \"It significantly underestimates the negative impact on internal compliance programs and significantly overestimates our capacity to effectively triage and manage whistleblower complaints,\" said SEC Commissioner Kathleen Casey. Supporters of the rule, such as the National Whistleblowers Center, lauded the agency for resisting opposition from corporate lobbyists. The rule is expected to take effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is working on a similar rule. (Reporting by Sarah N.

      " DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC has had talks with General Motors Corp about a deal to combine the No. 1 and No. 3 American automakers at a time when both are struggling to cut costs and shore up cash, sources have said. The No. 3 U.S. automaker has specifically declined to comment on the talks, but Chrysler Chief executive Bob Nardelli said the automaker is talking to a number of firms on potential tie-ups. Following is the text of the Chrysler CEO's letter to employees, sent on Monday at 6 am EDT. Dear Employees, Last week was marked by news headlines unlike anything most of us have seen in our careers. Global financial markets are in turmoil and continue to seek stability as governments work to restore confidence in their banking and financial institutions. Here in the United States, on the heels of record-low consumer sentiment and the mortgage crisis, the credit crunch now presents a more serious issue to the automotive industry than four-dollar-a-gallon gasoline. On Friday, the stock market recorded its eighth consecutive decline, including the worst week on record for the S&P 500 index. Other headlines you may have seen over the weekend reported that GM and Ford had been talking about a merger, and also that there is a possibility of one between Chrysler and GM. As a matter of policy, Chrysler does not comment on speculation or discuss its private business meetings, but I would like to give you a few facts to keep in mind. The leadership team has shared with you on an ongoing basis that the Company is looking at a number of potential global partnerships as it explores growth opportunities around the world. Some of these already announced include our OEM agreements for small cars and trucks with Nissan and for minivan production in North America with Volkswagen. To protect the integrity of our Company and those with whom we meet, we do not confirm or disclose the nature of our business meetings, as many times they do not lead anywhere. I can tell you that we have approached and have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities with Chrysler. As the Company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets, we engage in a dialogue with these parties. We do so keeping in mind our vision, our mission, and the best interests of those who have shown tremendous support for this Company -- including you, our employees, dealers, suppliers and customers. It's important for you to know that beyond those partnerships already announced, Chrysler has not formed any new agreements and has no announcements to make at this time. On behalf of the Office of the Chairman and the entire leadership team, I appreciate your continued hard work and your tireless efforts to restore Chrysler to its rightful place in the automotive industry. The focus and dedication you show at this unusually challenging time reflect the strength and the fighting spirit that has made Chrysler the company it is today, and will be tomorrow. Sincerely, Bob (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Gerald E. McCormick) || 1\n",

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - The London recording studio immortalized by the multi-million-selling Beatles album of the same name has been put up for sale by its owners. Debt-laden music company EMI is seeking buyers for Abbey Road Studios, a mecca for Beatles fans around the world who pose for photographs imitating the picture on the 1969 \"Abbey Road\" album cover which shows Paul, John, George and Ringo strolling over a pedestrian crossing outside the studio. EMI is talking to a few interested parties about selling the North London studios, but a deal is not imminent, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters. The company and its private equity owner Terra Firma declined to comment. Abbey Road, which began life as a Georgian town house built in 1831, has an impressive history aside from the Beatles, who recorded most of their 1960s hit singles and albums there under the direction of EMI house producer George Martin. Its walls have also echoed to music performed by classical composer Edward Elgar, rock bands Pink Floyd and Radiohead, violin maestro Yehudi Menuhin, 1980s bands Spandau Ballet and Simple Minds, as well as Mike Oldfield and Jeff Beck. A sale that includes the brand could raise 25 to 30 million pounds ($39 million to $47 million), the person said. Terra Firma recently told investors it needed more than 100 million pounds to stop EMI breaching banking covenants. A 4 billion pound deal to buy the record label in 2007 has come to epitomize the woes of buyout deals done at the private equity bubble, with a high debt burden and a weak performance crippling the business. The investment has been so tumultuous for Terra Firma that it recently launched a lawsuit against Citigroup claiming the U.S. bank inflated the price of the business during the sale process by not revealing the only other bidder had withdrawn from the auction. Citigroup denies the allegations. (Additional reporting by  Simon Meads , editing by Paul Casciato and  Andrew Dobbie ) || -1\n",

AIG used to be one of those companies.\" American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) shares, after rallying ahead of the results on Thursday, closed down $3.80, or 9.67 percent, at $35.48 on Friday. The insurer's latest results included $1.95 billion in special gains, sending AIG into the black once more, and helping to offset declines in operating revenue at its insurance businesses. Net income was $455 million, compared with a loss of $24.47 billion, in the year-earlier quarter. Its profit in the second quarter was $1.8 billion. The gains in the latest quarter included improvement in the value of securities held by AIG Financial Products, basically a reversal of the losses that were the primary driver in AIG's near collapse last year. AIG has received up to $180 billion of federal aid, including more than $80 billion in loans, and is now 80 percent-owned by U.S. taxpayers. \"We continue to focus on stabilizing and strengthening our businesses, but expect continued volatility in reported results in the coming quarters,\" said Chief Executive Robert Benmosche, in the earnings statement. The company had sought to sell off major assets to help repay the United States. But it has struggled to find buyers willing to pay enough. But AIG said it will significantly reduce its federal loan balance in the fourth quarter as it completes a $25 billion pact with the Federal Reserve, giving the Fed a preferred stakes in life insurance units, AIA and Alico. As a result, AIG will record a charge of about $5 billion related to that deal and another $1.4 billion charge from its $2.15 billion October sale of Taiwan life insurance unit Nan Shan. DIFFICULT LANDSCAPE CreditSights' Haines said it was a positive that AIG did not have any \"bombshell\" investment losses in the latest quarter, but that it would need to make bigger strides in repaying taxpayers and show several quarters of growth within its insurance operations, before anyone could take it seriously. Insurers widely reported a drop in sales to policyholders in the third quarter, as the effects of rising unemployment and a contraction in spending reduced demand for coverage. But the situation at AIG, which had already lost business in the wake of its taxpayer bailout, may be especially acute. AIG's general insurance operations reported a 13 percent decline in net policy sales. Life insurance and retirement services had a 16 percent drop in premium income. The divisions reported quarterly operating profits thanks to higher net investment income, compared with losses a year earlier. AIG, for the second quarter in a row, did not hold its customary post-earnings call with investors. Management was also not available to comment further to the media, said a spokeswoman. It may be that Benmosche, who had been vocal in his early days as CEO, is waiting until he has better news to divulge, or at least a rock solid plan for recovery. \"If a company that has a severe economic or financial problem and has not yet arrived at a solution that is realistic, it is much better not holding news or investor conferences,\" said Howard Rubenstein, president of public relations firm Rubenstein Associates. Rubenstein was not speaking specifically about AIG, a company he has advised in the past. (Reporting by Lilla Zuill; editing by  Derek Caney , Dave Zimmerman and  Andre Grenon ) || 1\n",

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - McAfee Inc MFE.N, the No. 2 U.S. security software maker, reported quarterly revenue that missed Wall Street projections as sales to consumers grew at their slowest rate in almost two years. The company's shares fell 4.5 percent as the revenue shortfall, which came in the wake of substantially stronger-than-expected earnings from bigger rival Symantec Corp ( SYMC.O ), overshadowed better-than-expected profit. McAfee on Thursday reported profit, excluding items, of 62 cents per share, in the third quarter ended September 30, above the average forecast of 60 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 18 percent to $485 million, below the $487 million average analyst forecast. Sales of McAfee's consumer software rose 8 percent from a year earlier to $177 million. It was the slowest rate of growth since the fourth quarter of 2007. Its corporate business reported a 25 percent sales increase, posting quarterly revenue of $308 million. Investors closely watch sales of consumer software because analysts say that such products are more profitable than programs for businesses. The company does not disclose the profits of each division. McAfee also said that it has agreed to pay No. 2 PC maker Dell Inc DELL.O to recommend its security software to its customers worldwide for at least the next two years. McAfee has the right to extend for a third year. \"This relationship is very profitable for McAfee,\" said Chief Executive Dave DeWalt, who has negotiated deals with other PC makers that have boosted sales of consumer software in previous quarters. Those sales grew at a year-on-year rate of 13 percent in the second quarter and 12 percent in the first quarter. The company forecast that it will report fourth-quarter profit, excluding items, of 61 to 65 cents per share on revenue of $505 million to $525 million. Analysts expect McAfee to post profit of 63 cents per share on revenue of $507 million. Net income fell 25 percent to $37 million, or 23 cents per share, from $49 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier. McAfee shares fell 4.5 percent to $41.80 from their New York Stock Exchange close of $43.75. (Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Leslie Gevirtz) || 1\n",

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Greece, pressing for curbs on financial speculation that it blames for worsening the country's debt crisis, said on Tuesday the idea would be examined by the Group of 20 leading powers at their next summit. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told reporters after meeting with President Barack Obama that the U.S. leader had been encouraging on Athens' effort to restrict speculators. A U.S. official, however, offered a very measured response when asked about the call for curbs on instruments like credit default swaps, leaving unclear the degree to which Washington supported Papandreou's effort. \"We have found a positive response from President Obama, which means that this issue will be on the agenda in the next G20 meeting,\" the Greek prime minister said after the White House meeting. \"We ourselves were in the last few months the victims of speculators. Obama assured me that he considers the initiative useful, important, positive and that the United States will contribute in this direction,\" he added. Canada hosts the next summit of the Group of 20 political leaders in June, although G20 finance ministers will gather in Washington in late April. The meeting with Obama was part of a concentrated series of international appearances by Papandreou aimed at enlisting major power support and shoring up investor confidence in Greece's ability to get through its budget crisis. A senior Greek official, speaking to reporters after the meeting with Obama, said the United States would present its own plans at the G20 to damp down financial speculation. He said the U.S. proposals could go beyond the ban on naked selling of derivatives the European Commission on Tuesday said it would consider. Naked selling involves selling a credit default swap to a buyer who does not hold the underlying sovereign bond, which is usually a bet the bond will default. Asked about Papandreou's call for curbs on speculation, an Obama administration official simply said that the United States was already working on a broad overhaul of U.S. financial regulation. \"The president's plan would require more transparent trading and central clearing for standardized derivatives,\" the official said, adding that this would help regulators crack down on market manipulation and abuse. NOT SPECULATION Washington made plain its belief that the main source of Greece's budget problems was not market speculators. \"The central task before the Greek government is to continue to move forward on their plans to restore fiscal stability and growth to its economy,\" the official said. Greece was forced to take unpopular steps to slash spending after discovering the country's budget deficit had been understated by half, a discovery that spooked global investors and drove its borrowing costs sharply higher. \"I see most of what has happened here as really aimed at Greek domestic opinion,\" said Jacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"Coming to the U.S. is a photo op with Obama that is domestic-opinion orientated.\" Athens says activities such as short selling by investors of securities they do not own inflates debt costs for countries struggling to cut deficits. Greece's borrowing costs have surged this year, although yields have declined somewhat since the government announced its fiscal austerity package. On Tuesday, the yield spread of 10-year Greek government bonds over German bunds traded around 293 basis points, beneath a peak of more than 400 basis points reached in late January. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday there were \"positive\" signs that Greece was making progress, including its recent successful government bond issue. \"In my assessment, Greece does not need any financial support,\" she told journalists in Luxembourg. Papandreou also said he was not in Washington to seek aid. Greek officials visited the International Monetary Fund on Monday for informal talks, but there was no indication that there had been any discussion of aid. Papandreou has suggested that seeking IMF assistance was possible if all else failed. The IMF has remained on the fringes of the Greek crisis, sensitive to calls by European leaders that they want to deal with Greece as a member of the euro zone.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc's hefty iPhone price cut pits it in direct competition with handsets from Motorola Inc and Palm Inc, which are struggling to convince Wall Street they can turn around their aging brands. With the music-playing iPhone now selling at $399 instead of $599, its price tag is much closer to other smartphones in the U.S. market, including Palm's Treo and Motorola's Razr2. \"This is Palm's main market,\" said Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff, who does not see Apple's move as having as big an impact on Nokia Oyj and other handset makers. Palm, which is entirely dependent on the smartphone market, sold 2.7 million phones in its last fiscal year ended in June. The Treo, often used by business clients for e-mail and Web surfing, sells for up to $399 at Verizon Wireless, or $199 at Sprint Nextel Corp to customers who sign a contract. Palm said in June it expected the touch-screen iPhone to temporarily slow Treo demand, and Oppenheimer analyst Lawrence Harris said Apple's price cut could exacerbate this. \"It has the potential to take away from Treo sales,\" Harris said, adding that the move could make the low end of the handset market increasingly important for Palm. \"I think that's why you're going to see additional emphasis on cheaper models like the Centro,\" he said, referring to a phone Palm is expected to release in coming weeks for $99. Some analysts said iPhone, which has only been in the market for two months, would not sell in enough volume to noticeably hurt bigger handset makers. Apple has forecast 1 million units sold by the end of September and 10 million by the end of 2008. But other analysts said the iPhone, while still pricier than the latest Razr, carries a lot more brand cachet with consumers than Motorola's tired line-up. Even before Apple's move into the mobile market, Motorola has been struggling to regain market share amid criticism for not coming up with a strong follow-up to the Razr. It recently launched an advanced model of its flagship phone, the Razr2, in the United States for $249 to $299. \"The iPhone will still sell at a premium to the Razr2 but the difference has narrowed,\" Harris said. \"It does put pressure on Motorola to show some new products or discuss their product strategy on Friday,\" he said, referring to Motorola's scheduled analyst day, where investors will be looking for any plans for new handset models. Investors will want to know Motorola's U.S. plans for touch-screen phones, which users control by moving their fingers across the screen, for example. The touch-sensitive iPhone screen was one of the device's most touted features. Many analysts see the iPhone having less impact on companies like Nokia, Samsung Electronics Co and LG Electronics Inc because they have a broader range of phones than Palm. But FTN Midwest analyst Blaine Carroll said Palm would not be the only company to lose out to iPhone. \"I think it will take a little share across the board in general. The price cut just makes it a little more affordable. I don't think the price cut necessarily changes the dynamic of the market,\" Carroll said. || -1\n",

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Italian shoe maker Geox SpA ( GEO.MI ) could see its revenues and stock price rise in the coming years as it executes its expansion plan, according to a report in the latest issue of Barron's financial newspaper. After a recent sell-off in the shares, fueled by disappointing sales and profit growth and a reduced earnings forecast, the stock has fallen to levels that underestimate Geox's growth potential, earnings power, and \"pristine balance sheet,\" the paper said in its July 28 edition. Geox shares trade for about 7 euros, and its lightly traded American shares ( GXSBF.PK ) have fallen to $10.70 on the Pink Sheets from $24.15 last October. However, if sales and earnings climb by an expected 15 percent to 20 percent a year, Geox could rally to 9-11 euros in the next two to three years, a gain of 30 percent to 50 percent, the paper said. Geox is \"a great company with a temporary problem,\" Sebastien Mallet, an analyst with T. Rowe Price, which owns about 5.27 million shares, told Barron's. The United States, home to just 16 Geox stores, accounts for a mere 3 percent of total sales, but U.S.-based sales rose 28 percent -- or 40 percent in dollars -- in 2007, even without the benefit of heavy advertising, the paper said. Europe currently accounts for 83 percent of Geox sales. Geox hopes to have 30 stores in the U.S. by year end, the paper said, citing comments from the company's chief financial officer. That number could double by 2010, and reach 100 or more afterward. Geox will open about 400 new stores in Europe in the next three years and ramp up expansion in Southeast Asia, China and Japan, where it has a small presence. Geox sales could double to 1.6 billion euros in five years, according to Scilla Huang Sun, a portfolio manager at Bank Julius Baer, the paper said.

    "x = [\"Fiscal 2019 was a year of transition for Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). For one thing, Disney completed its acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox around the middle of the fiscal year. The company also spent much of the year preparing for a shift in its business model toward a greater emphasis on direct-to-consumer entertainment -- particularly the Disney+ streaming service, which will launch in just a few days.These two developments have weighed on results in recent quarters. But the House of Mouse benefited from a strong film slate over the summer, helping it to post solid financial results in the final quarter of fiscal 2019.Earnings per share fall, but still beat expectationsDisney generated revenue of 19.1 billion last quarter -- up from $14.3 billion a year earlier -- mainly due to the Fox acquisition. Total segment operating income increased 5% to 3.4 billion, despite the company now booking Hulu's entire loss in its financial results after taking full control of the streaming service earlier this year.Outside of its segment results, Disney is experiencing severe earnings pressure, mainly from amortization expenses related to buying Fox and Hulu. Higher interest expense (from the debt it issued to fund the Fox deal), higher corporate overhead costs, and other one-time items also hurt earnings. Lastly, Disney's share count increased in conjunction with the Fox acquisition.As a result, EPS plunged 72% to 0.43 last quarter. On an adjusted basis -- excluding various one-time items -- EPS fell 28% year over year: from $1.48 to $1.07. That easily beat the average analyst estimate of 0.95. CFO Christine McCarthy also estimated that the dilution from buying Fox and Hulu reduced EPS by about $0.47. In other words, on a like-for-like basis, earnings grew for the core Disney business.\"]\n",

    "IRVING, Texas and DANBURY, Conn., Nov. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy, Inc. said today they have signed a new, two-year expanded joint-development agreement to further enhance carbonate fuel cell technology for the purpose of capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agreement, worth up to $60 million, will focus efforts on optimizing the core technology, overall process integration and large-scale deployment of carbon capture solutions. ExxonMobil is exploring options to conduct a pilot test of next-generation fuel cell carbon capture solution at one of its operating sites.  \n",
    "\n",
    "“ExxonMobil is working to advance carbon capture technologies while reducing costs and enhancing scalability,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development for ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “This expanded agreement with FuelCell Energy will enable further progress on this unique carbon capture solution that has the potential to achieve meaningful reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from industrial operations.”\n",
    "\n",
    "FuelCell Energy’s proprietary technology uses carbonate fuel cells to efficiently capture and concentrate carbon dioxide streams from large industrial sources. Combustion exhaust is directed to the fuel cell, which produces power while capturing and concentrating carbon dioxide for permanent storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modular design enables the technology to be deployed at a wide range of locations, which could lead to a more cost-efficient path for large-scale deployment of carbon capture and sequestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Today’s announcement underscores our leadership position in fuel cell technology,” said Jason Few, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy. “We are excited to continue to work with ExxonMobil to tackle one of the biggest challenges that exists today. We have a great opportunity to scale and commercialize our unique carbon capture solution, one that captures about 90 percent of carbon dioxide from various exhaust streams, while generating additional power, unlike traditional carbon capture technologies which consume significant power.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "“FuelCell Energy has always been proud of our technology and our role in reshaping the environmental impact of industry and electrical generation. This is another giant step forward towards the large-scale deployment of this much needed technology.”\n",
    "\n",
    "ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy began working together in 2016 with a focus on better understanding the fundamental science behind carbonate fuel cells and how to increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power generation. The new and expanded agreement will prioritize the optimization of the core carbon capture technology for integration into large-scale industrial facilities such as refineries and chemical plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "ExxonMobil engineers and scientists have researched, developed and applied technologies that could play a role in the widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage for more than 30 years. The company has a working interest in approximately one-fifth of the world’s total carbon capture capacity, and has captured about 7 million tonnes per year of carbon dioxide. ExxonMobil has captured more carbon dioxide than any other company.\n",
